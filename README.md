## 📦 Versions &amp; downloads

> [!NOTE]
> This repo uses a **branch-per-version** layout. This `main` branch is **documentation only** — the code for each Minecraft version lives on its own branch, each with an independent history and its own `CHANGELOG.md`.

| Branch | Minecraft | Loaders | Dependencies | Log |
|:------:|:---------:|:-------:|:------------:|:---:|
| [`multi_26.2`](https://github.com/LunixiaLIVE/svrUptime/tree/multi_26.2) | 26.2.x | Fabric · NeoForge | Fabric API *(Fabric only)* | [📄](https://github.com/LunixiaLIVE/svrUptime/blob/multi_26.2/CHANGELOG.md) |
| [`multi_26.1`](https://github.com/LunixiaLIVE/svrUptime/tree/multi_26.1) | 26.1, 26.1.1, 26.1.2 | Fabric · NeoForge | Fabric API *(Fabric only)* | [📄](https://github.com/LunixiaLIVE/svrUptime/blob/multi_26.1/CHANGELOG.md) |

| [`plugin_1.21.11`](https://github.com/LunixiaLIVE/svrUptime/tree/plugin_1.21.11) | 1.21.11 | Paper | Paper (no extra deps) | — |

> [!TIP]
> Every `multi_*` branch builds **one universal jar** that runs on **both** Fabric and NeoForge (per-loader `-fabric` / `-neoforge` jars are produced too). All of them are fully standalone — **no Architectury API at runtime**.

<details>
<summary>🛠️ <b>Building from source</b></summary>

Each code branch is a self-contained Gradle project. Grab the branch for your Minecraft version:

```bash
git clone -b multi_26.2 https://github.com/LunixiaLIVE/svrUptime.git
cd svrUptime
./gradlew build
```

The universal jar lands in `build/libs/` — drop it into your `mods/` folder on either loader.
